# Deep-Learning

This project utilizes a jupyter notebook to examine the performance of a TensorFlow Keras deep learning model and whether that performance can be enhanced with optimization and different data preprocessing techniques.<br>

To examine the data, code files, and final report, their locations are indicated in the tree below.

#### Files/Folders:

+ **"Code"** (this folder contains the jupyter notebooks created for this assignment) <br>
	- *"AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb"* (initial model setup and performance test) <br>
	- *"AlphabetSoupCharity.h5"* (HDF5 version of the model) <br>
	-  *"AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb"* (optimized model setup and performance test) <br>
	- *"AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5"* (HDF5 version of the model) <br>
+ **"Data"** (this folder contains the input data file) <br>
	- *"charity_data.csv"* (file containing the training/testing data) <br>
+ **"Final Report"** (this folder contains the final report) <br>
	- *"Deep Learning Final Report.pdf"* (read to find out the details of the model creation, optimization, and results) <br>
	

#### Note: <br>

Please do not delete, move, rename, or alter any of these folders and/or files. <br>
Also, the jupyter notebooks and h5 files should be run in Google Colaboratory. <br>
Thank you. <br>
