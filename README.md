# Machine-Learning-Deep (Charity Funding Success Predictor)

#### Overview:
This project utilizes a TensorFlow Keras neural network model to predict the successfulness funding various charities for Alphabet Soup.
It illustrates how prediction performance can be improved with various data preprocessing techniques and also careful model parameter optimization.
